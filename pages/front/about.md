# About

I am a full-stack and DevOps developer who enjoys working with functional programming languages.

Currently I'm active member of [Hasura team](https://hasura.io). They are great team with genius Haskell variants to learn and work with. Before that, I experienced many outsourcing and startup projects.

I'm not really smart. However I try hard and learn from failures.
